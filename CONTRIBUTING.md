# Contributing to MLX AI Studio

First off, thank you for considering contributing to MLX AI Studio! It's people like you that make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create.

## 🔒 The "Private-First" Development Model

While MLX AI Studio is an **Open Source** project licensed under **Apache 2.0**, we operate under a **Private-First** development model to ensure the highest standards of code quality and security.

### Why?
In the era of Generative AI, many open repositories now face a flood of low-quality, AI-generated Pull Requests that require intensive scrutiny to review. To maintain the integrity and stability of MLX AI Studio for our users, **direct code contributions to this public repository are restricted.**

### What lives where?
- **[Public Repository] (This Repo):** Contains Documentation, Installation Scripts, Pre-built Binaries/Releases, and the Issue Tracker.
- **[Private Repository]:** Contains the active source code, development branches, and CI/CD pipelines.

## 🤝 How to contribute

You can contribute in several meaningful ways without needing access to the private source code:

### 1. Report Bugs & Suggest Features
The [Issue Tracker](issues) on this public repository is the central hub for all project feedback.
- **Found a bug?** Open an issue with a clear reproduction path.
- **Have an idea?** Open a Feature Request to discuss it with the community.

### 2. Improve Documentation
Documentation serves all users! We **DO** accept Pull Requests on this public repository for:
- Fixing typos or clarity in `README.md` or `docs/`.
- Improvements to installation scripts.
- Adding examples or tutorials.

### 3. Apply to join the Core Team
If you are a developer who wants to contribute actual code fixes or features:
1. Start by being active in the Issues (triaging bugs, helping users).
2. Submit high-quality issues that demonstrate your understanding of the codebase.
3. Express your interest in joining the development team by contacting the project maintainers directly or posting in a designated "Contributor Application" discussion thread (when available).

**Once approved, you will be manually added to the Private Repository where you can submit Pull Requests via the standard workflow.**

## 🛠 Development Process (For Private Repo Contributors)

For those with access to the private source, our workflow is standard:
1.  **Fork/Branch** off `main` in the private repo.
2.  **Code** your feature or fix.
3.  **Test** locally using the project's test suite.
4.  **Submit a PR** to the private repository.
5.  All code must pass strict linting (`ruff`) and type checking (`mypy`) before merger.
